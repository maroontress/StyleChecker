# AssignmentToParameter

![AssignmentToParameter][fig-AssignmentToParameter]

## Summary

Assignment to parameters must be avoided.

## Default severity

Warning

## Description

This rule reports diagnostic information of assignment to the parameters
passed _by value_ (except _by reference_). Note that
\[[1](#ref1)\]:

> Do not confuse the concept of passing _by reference_ with the concept of
> reference types. The two concepts are not the same. A method parameter can be
> modified by `ref` regardless of whether it is a value type or a reference
> type. There is no boxing of a value type when it is passed _by reference_.

Those who are unfamiliar with C# often assign a new value to the parameters
passed _by value_, with the intention that the assignment will be reflected in
the caller's variables. This rule allows them to immediately notice that
they confused or misled themselves.

The diagnostic for a parameter passed _by value_ is reported when the method
does as follows:

- Assign a new value to it
- Increment or decrement it
- Pass it to any method as the `ref` or `out` parameter.

## Code fix

The code fix is not provided.

## Example

### Diagnostic

```csharp
public int Method(int length)
{
    if (length < 0)
    {
        length = 0;
    }
    length += 1;

    ++length;
    --length;

    OtherMethod(ref length);
    AnotherMethod(out length);
    â‹®
```
